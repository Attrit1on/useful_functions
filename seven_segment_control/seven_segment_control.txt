/* sevenSegmentControl(uint8_t displayVal)
 * Returns the byte needed in a register to represent displayVal on 
 * a seven segment display in hex wired with all segments to a single 
 * port as described in the table below.  This code was executed with 
 * the display wired to PORTC of the Arduino Mega platform.
 * 
 * The segment field corresponds to the segment of the display to be
 * controlled(segment map to right of table).  The port_bit refers 
 * to the bits in a single port of the arduino to be used.  In this  
 * case, the pin field corresponds to the appropriate pins needed to 
 * correctly utilize PORTC of the Arduino Mega platform.
 * 
 * ---THIS IS FOR COMMON CATHODE DISPLAYS---
 * 
 *   PORTC[0:6] => Digital Pins 37:31
